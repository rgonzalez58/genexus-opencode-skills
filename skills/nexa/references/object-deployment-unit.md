# DEFINITION
A `Deployment Unit` object (or `DPU`) defines a set of objects to be deployed together

Typically, applications split deployment units by layers such as front office, backend, and services

# CONSTRAINTS
- Use [global-constraints](./global-constraints.md)
- Include only deployable references supported by GeneXus Deployment Unit object scope (main objects, file objects, and business process diagram objects)
- Declare one referenced object per line
- Qualify object names by module when applicable
- Never duplicate object references inside the same deployment unit
- For updates, preserve unchanged object entries and modify only requested items
- Might be referenced by name in `#DeploymentUnits` region of [Environment](./model-environment.md) file

# REMARKS
- Deploying a `Deployment Unit` object packages the objects defined in it and their dependencies according to GeneXus deployment behavior
