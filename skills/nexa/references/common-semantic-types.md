description: Predefined domains with specific semantics enabling automatic behaviors
---

Built-in domains that automatically enable behaviors based on element name

---

# USAGE POLICY
- Evaluate semantic built-ins before creating or assigning custom domains
- If an element meaning matches a semantic built-in, use its qualified name and do not create a new `Domain` object
- Never create custom domains named `Email`, `Phone`, `Url`, `Html`, or `Address` when the corresponding `GeneXus` semantic domain applies
