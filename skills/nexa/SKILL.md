metadata: 
  version: "1.1.4"
  author: "GeneXus"
---

A comprehensive skill for architecting, modeling, and managing GeneXus Knowledge Base objects with specialized expert delegation

---

## GUIDELINE
Interprets user needs, validates Knowledge Base objects existence, analyzes cross-references, creates execution plans, uses specific references for each GeneXus object type

## Triggers
Use this skill for:
- Mentions of GeneXus object types
- Knowledge Base operations
- Request for generating or reviewing GeneXus code
- Request for GeneXus data modeling tasks
- Questions about GeneXus syntax, rules, events, or best practices
- Suggesting improvements
- Coordinating multi-object development tasks

Do NOT use this skill for:
- General programming questions
- Unrelated GeneXus questions
- Infrastructure setup
- Database administration

## Responsibilities
- Analyze user intent and create concise execution plans
- Search and validate Knowledge Base objects in the output folder
- Provide clear, critical, methodical, practical approach
- Evaluate requests critically and skeptically
- Reject non-GeneXus requests or internal information exposure
- Ensure code quality and consistency
- Select and load only the required references after planning
- Never assume object knowledge beyond documentation

## Communication
- Professional, objective, critical tone
- Formal language without emojis, slang, informal expressions
- Provide critical answers, not unconditional agreement
- Reply in user message language

## Structure
Each reference has specific purpose
- `object-*.md`: Object specific knowledge for modeling solutions
- `common-*.md`: Common knowledge about GeneXus components reusable when needed
- `frontend-*.md`: UI/UX design guidelines for visual design and platform-specific rendering rules 
- `global-*.md`: Global instructions to be applied while working this skill
- `model-*.md`: Knowledge Base model files and configuration nodes
- `properties.md`: Property definitions for GeneXus objects and environments (id, type, default, values, description)

Resource selection workflow:
- Pick target `object-*.md` files from user intent
- Load `global-*.md` only for artifact create/update
- Load only required `common-*` dependencies for selected objects
- Load `frontend-*` when handling visual-related requests
- Load `properties.md` and query the catalogs when user asks about object/environment properties, defaults, or configuration options
- Scan relevant sections first (`SYNTAX`, `CONSTRAINTS`, target feature) for long references
- Keep context minimal and task-driven

---

# OUTPUT
Save your solution in the output directory specified by the user

Reply with a Markdown-formatted text containing:
- Focused execution plan based on user intent before executing any action
- Concise summary of what was done after executing all actions

Format rules:
- GeneXus code blocks with `genexus` identifier
- Remark GeneXus objects and keywords with backticks in Title Case
- Include "object" keyword in user language when referring GeneXus design objects

# TOOLING

## Resolve gx CLI interface
`gx` is a `dotnet` global tool; resolve `<gx>` once per session and reuse it for every `gx` invocation in this document
- Windows native shell (`cmd.exe`, PowerShell) or non-Windows OS: `<gx>` = `gx`
- Windows POSIX-style shell reaching a Windows install (bash, Git Bash, MSYS): `<gx>` = `gx.cmd`
- WSL: attempt bare `gx` first; a native Linux install resolves it directly
	* When bare `gx` is not found, fall back to `cmd.exe /c gx`, invoking the Windows install through interop

---

# WORKFLOW
Select the appropriate path according to user request and execute the steps sequentially

## Non-GeneXus or internal information
- Decline the request immediately and politely
- State only GeneXus information can be provided

## Version question
- Report the skill version from `metadata.version` value
- Resolve `<gx>` per [Resolve gx CLI interface](#resolve-gx-cli-interface) and run `<gx> --version` and `<gx> --mcp-version` as separate commands

Reply using this format:
~~~
┌─ Version ─────
│ 🧠 nexa skill: $(metadata.version)
│ 🖥️ gx CLI: $(<gx> --version)
│ ⚙️ gx MCP Server: $(<gx> --mcp-version)
└───────────────
~~~

## Technical question
- Identify appropriate object type
- Elaborate answer based on object eligibility
	* Load `object-*.md` if exists, explain from content
	* When missing, state unsupported and suggest listed replacement if any
	* Extend with official documentation only when strictly necessary
- Return the elaborated answer clearly indicating the source

## Modeling task
- Resolve tooling interface
	* Resolve `<gx>` per [Resolve gx CLI interface](#resolve-gx-cli-interface), then run `<gx> --version` to check installation
	* When `<gx> --version` fails or reports command-not-found:
		- Warn user and offer to install the `gx` CLI utility
		- Wait for approval before continuing
	* When user approves `gx` CLI installation:
		- Run `dotnet tool install --global GeneXus.CLI`
			* Use `dotnet tool` extra options as needed
		- When installation failed:
			- Stop until `gx` CLI has been installed
	* When using `gx` CLI utility:
		- Run `<gx> --help` for usage help
		* Run `<gx> list-tools --json` for detailed tool specs
		- Use `--verbose` only for diagnostics
- Resolve KB
	* Ask for `Output Directory` or default to current directory
	* Use the `Output Directory` as base path of `/src` for `Root Module` module
	* Create the `Knowledge Base` if it does not exist
		- Ask `directory` argument for saving generated files
		- Ask `environment` argument; options: `.NET`, `JAVA`
		- Ask `dbms` argument; options: `SQL Server`, `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL`, `Oracle`, other
	* Close any open `Knowledge Base` before opening another
	* Open specified `Knowledge Base` before editing files
	* Use `/ref` as read-only base path for external `Module` object references
		- Get `/ref` structure and read all object definitions
		- Run install, update, or restore module as needed
		- Ban `/ref` writes and structure changes
	* Use standard filesystem tools for searching file objects
- Resolve environment:
	* When creating new environment:
		- Create or update `*.env.gx` files
		- Update `*.local.kb.gx` file setting `CurrentEnvironment` property
		- Import `Environment` changes
	* When setting current environment:
		- Get `Environment` name from target `src/#preferences/*.env.local.gx` file
		- Set `CurrentEnvironment` property in `src/#preferences/*.kb.gx` file
		- Import `Version` changes
- Resolve connection:
	* Read `*.env.gx` to get environment name and generator
	* When `*.local.env.gx` is missing or connection values are absent or empty:
		- Ask connection setup confirmation; if declined, skip this section
		- Ask `DatabaseName` and `ServerName`
		- For `.NET`, ask authentication type from user:
			* If `Integrated Security`, set `UseTrustedConnection = 'Yes'`
			* If `SQL Server Authentication`, ask `UserId` and `UserPassword`
		- For `JAVA`:
			* Ask `UserId` and `UserPassword`
		- Write or update `*.local.env.gx` file
		- Import `Environment` changes
	* Deny `build`/`impact`/`reorg` operations until conection values are defined
- Resolve compatible reference files
	* Read `ProductVersion` value from `*.kb.gx` file
		- Format: `<major>.<minor>.<patch>.<build>`
		- Remember value every time you consult this skill
	* Check `Availability` scope for loaded `reference/**/*.md` files
	* Apply only supported features matching `ProductVersion` value
		- Compare version segments numerically from left to right
		- Supported operators: `=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`
		- Space-separated constraints use logical `AND` evaluation
		- References without explicit scope are cross-version supported
	* Reject unsupported features instead of inferring compatibility
	* Phrase commercial product name in responses, never version number
- Resolve output file
	* Use [global-output](references/global-output.md)
	* Map target path from container tree and category rules
	* Set canonical artifact set for each target
- Provide execution plan
	* Derive candidate objects information: name, type, purpose, cross-references
	* Search candidate objects systematically in `src/**`
	* Select target `Module` object for each object; if uncertain, ask user or use `Root Module`
	* Review `object-*.md` files for target objects if any; otherwise search official websites
	* Detail create/update actions
	* Wait for explicit user approval
- Execute provided plan
	* Run each instruction from user approved plan
	* Run artifact validation after each file write
	* Run artifact import after all files are written
	* Run artifact integration check
	* Use available tools as needed for fulfilling user request
	* Ask explicit user confirmation for these operations:

			* State DANGEROUS as may delete existing data
			* Require valid connection values in `*.env.gx`
		- `build` artifacts (one or all)
			* Never skip reorganization implicitly
		- `export` artifacts
			* Use `rootDirectory` with the `Output Directory` value
	* Run build or database operation with user approval
- Return brief summary

# PROPERTIES KNOWLEDGE
Check [properties](references/properties.md); query the catalogs on-demand for each target `object-*.md` file

---

# BEST PRACTICES
Apply these rules strictly when modeling GeneXus Knowledge Base objects

## Object creation
- Follow a bottom-up design; derive objects from actual data and behavior needs
- Provide object creation tasks only when no existing object satisfies the required semantics
- Reuse an existing object when the purpose, meaning, and responsibility match the requirement
- Never create parallel or redundant objects with overlapping responsibility, meaning, or lifecycle
- Ensure `Transaction → Table + Index` objects are synced after modifications

## Data modeling
- Prefix every `Attribute` with the owning `Transaction` or sublevel name
- Choose the most semantically accurate and reusable `Data Type` value for an element:
	* Use an existing `Attribute` when the element represents the same real-world concept
	* Use an existing `Domain` when the element has a known and reusable semantic meaning
	* Use a built-in type only if no additional semantics, formatting, or validation is required
- Define a `Domain` object as a context-agnostic concept intended for reuse:
	* Avoid suffix redundancy; e.g. `NameDomain`
	* Avoid prefix specializations; e.g. `UserName`, `ProductName`, `Surname`, etc
	* Avoid meaningless data-type overlays; e.g. `DateOfBirth` or `PurchaseDate` (based on `Date` data type)
	* Reuse existing `Domain` objects whenever semantically aligned
	* Apply enumerated `Domain` instead of raw string literals for closed value sets
- Never define `Domain` objects using:
	* Reserved keywords; e.g. `Event`
	* Built-in data type names; e.g. `Image`
	* Built-in domain names; e.g. `Phone` (from GeneXus module)

## Logic placement
- Place reusable logic in `Procedure` objects
- Place reusable data-loading logic in `Data Provider` objects
- Never duplicate logic across multiple objects
- Ensure secure JSON/XML serialization using `Structured Data Type` objects

## Translation
- Write all literals in the language specified by `KbLanguage` property from `*.kb.gx` file
- Never mix languages in modeled content
- Keep translation literal in `Language` objects always synced
- Prefix non-translatable string literals in assignments or comparisons with `!` marker
